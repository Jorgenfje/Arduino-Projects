### ⚙️ Arduino Projects
Developed by Jørgen A. Fjellstad - 2025

A collection of Arduino-based projects created during my Data Engineering studies.  
Each folder contains a self-contained prototype demonstrating control systems, IoT integration, or embedded logic.  
The projects focus on both hardware functionality and clean, modular code design.

**Included Projects**
- `Alarmclock` → Digital alarm clock with real-time clock (RTC) module and OLED display  
- `Key-Lock-OLED` → Electronic lock system with keypad authentication and visual feedback  
- `Keypad` → Standalone keypad input handler with serial output  
- `Parking-System` → Ultrasonic parking assistant using distance sensors and LED indicators  
- `Smart-Plant-Pot` → Automatic watering system with soil moisture and temperature sensing  
- `Temp-Humid-Sensor-OLED` → Environmental monitor using DHT sensor and OLED display

**Technologies Used**
- Arduino C++ / AVR  
- I2C communication (OLED, RTC, sensors)  
- Analog and digital input/output control  
- Ultrasonic distance measurement  
- Sensor data acquisition and display  
- Embedded system timing and state management

### ▶️ Usage
Each folder contains:
- `.ino` file → main source code  
- Optional `README.md` → project description and wiring notes  
- Required libraries listed in comments at the top of each `.ino` file  

Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE, connect your board, and upload the sketch.

### 🔧 Notes
Some prototypes use external hardware (sensors, actuators, displays) for demonstration only.  
Schematics and pin connections are included where relevant inside each folder.  

This repository serves as a documentation archive for practical embedded projects and can be expanded with future IoT integrations.
